I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Sociology at the University of Chicago.

My research is in the areas of social network analysis, class politics, and the sociology of knowledge and science. My dissertation explores the impact of financialization on class politics in the capitalist core, in particular the United States and United Kingdom.
