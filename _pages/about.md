I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Sociology at the University of Chicago. I am on the academic job market for 2024-2025.

I study the causes and consequences of inequality in post-industrial economies. In particular, my research explores how social network and class structures encourage or discourage certain forms of collective action aimed at challenging this inequality. My dissertation explores the impact of financialization on class politics in the capitalist core, in particular the United States and United Kingdom.
